Measures how well a domain performs on search engine keyword queries. We analyze a large set of keywords relevant to your domain and measure your performance based on a proprietary formula that takes into account quality factors such as the search volume of each keyword and your search engine rank on those keywords. For example, a domain that ranks high on keywords that have high search volume will have a much higher score than a domain that performs well on low volume searches. Similarly, a domain that ranks on a large number of keyword searches will have a much higher score than a domain that ranks only on a small number of keyword searches, assuming that the keywords have roughly the same search volume. =
Measures how well a domain performs with regards to the CPC value of the SEO keywords that the domain ranks for.  For example, a domain with a high total CPC value indicates that the keywords the domain ranks for on SEO would require a high cost if you were to pay to rank for those keywords on paid search. =
Measures how well your domain is performing against an extensive set of relevant keyword searches.  We analyze a large set of keywords (over millions) and identify keywords that are relevant to your domain.  We then measure your performance on these keywords based on a proprietary formula that takes into account quality factors such as the search volume of each keyword and your search engine rank on those keywords.  For example, a domain that ranks high on keywords that have high search volume will have a much higher score than a domain that performs well on low volume searches.  Similarly, a domain that ranks on a large number of keyword searches will have a much higher score than a domain that ranks only on a small number of keyword searches, assuming that the keywords have roughly the same search volume. =

Keywords that rank on the upper right quadrant represents the domains top performing keyword segments. =
